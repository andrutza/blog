                <p>When you talk about love, it has to be unconditional. There is really no such thing as conditional
                    love and unconditional love. It is just that there are conditions and there is love. The moment there is a condition,
                    it just amounts to a transaction. Maybe a convenient transaction, maybe a good arrangement
                    - maybe many people made excellent arrangements in life - but that will not fulfill you; that will not transport you
                    to another dimension. It is just convenient.
                    What you do, what you do not do, is according to circumstances around you. Our actions are as the external
                    situation demands. What you do outside of yourself is always subject to many conditions. But love is an inner state
                    - how you are within yourself can definitely be unconditional.

                <p>'Family' is a single word, with many different meanings. People have many ways of defining a family
                    and what being a part of a family means to them. Families differ in terms of economic, cultural, social,
                    and many other facets, but what every family has in common is that the people who call it a family are making clear
                    that those people are important in some way to the person calling them his family.
                    The dictionary defines family in several ways. One definition is "a fundamental social group in society typically
                    consisting of one or two parents and their children." While this definition is a good starting point, there are several
                    modern family structures that are excluded by this definition, such as childless couples or other variations on
                    the family unit. Another definition is "Two or more people who share goals and values, have long-term commitments
                    to one another and reside usually in the same dwelling." This definition encompasses the vast majority of modern family
                    units; for the purposes of this article, the second definition will be used.

                <p>Many people consider friends to be as close or even closer than extended (or immediate) family.
                    People who have lost close family members may create a family unit of friends with similar interests and
                    goals to become replacements or enhancements to a lacking family structure. This type of family unit, while
                    untraditional, can be just as close, if not closer, than a traditional structure. Friends are chosen by an individual;
                    at times, these people may be more special or important than the family a person was born with. In addition,
                    some people who have supportive families also have an extensive network of friends who they consider to be a second
                    family or as additions to their blood or legal relatives.
                    Pets can also become members of a family unit. Pets add an element of responsibility to a family,
                    particularly for children. For couples who cannot, or choose not to, have children, pets can be a replacement
                    and be loved as dearly as children. Pets, such as dogs and cats, are cared for as additional family members by many
                    people and are mourned as such as well when they pass away.
